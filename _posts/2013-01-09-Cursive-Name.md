Dear Ivy,

Yet again you are showing your indomitable personality. We had a parent teacher conference with you 1st grade teacher, Mrs. Kappen. 

She explained very politely that you have been signing your name in cursive above your class assignments. The only problem is that you haven't learned to write in cursive just yet. Somehow you must have learned it on your own and started to write your name that way.

Mrs. Kappen says that you have been asked multiple times to sign your name in block letters so that it can be read easily but you've refused. When Mrs. Kappen asks for an explaination you simply say "because I want to write it that way". Mrs. Kappen respects your honestly and understands you need to progress beyond block letters but she is simply unable to convince you that you should move back to block letters.

Once again you are showing your strong will and singular focus. You want to grow up much faster than time will allow. We are trying our best to keep you challenged but still teach you to have respect and discipline. You'll be a fantastic adult, but don't get there too fast.
