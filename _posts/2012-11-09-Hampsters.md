Sadie, you wanted a hamster for a long time. In fact, you did chores for a whole month to get one. After hearing you ask for a hamster over the course of weeks, your mom drew up a contract. You had to clean your room, make your bed and clean the play room for a whole month. The first month didn't work out, so we started over. 

Your sister decided to join in to get a hamster of her own. We watched hamster videos on youtube for weeks leading up to the big day. You did your chores every dad, dreaming of taking home your very own hamster.

Finally the day came. We went to a couple of pet stores and found the perfect pair of hamsters. They are white with black spots. You named yours Fluffy then changed it to Snowball. She kind of has two names now. 

You were so happy. You have been very good at taking care of the little guys. Feeding them and taking them out to play.

I'm glad that we have them around and I am proud that you earned the right to have you very own pet. Kaisa even approves. She has been checking out the little rodents since hey came home.
