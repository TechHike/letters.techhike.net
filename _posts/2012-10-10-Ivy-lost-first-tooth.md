Ivy, your first loose tooth happened about 1 week ago. You were extremely excited about this new experience. As the tooth got more and more wiggley, you showed everyone you could, including me. I got more and more squimish as the tooth got looser but you insisted that I look at it. You worked it free over the course of a week. That tooth hung on for a long time!

Last night, you were obsessed with it. You had a wet paper towel on the tooth all night and at bed time you used a wet towel over the tooth. Your tummy started to feel bad before you fell asleep.

At around 11PM you puked all over the bed. It was a huge puke. I had no idea that a kid your size would have that much food in your tummy. I think that you were nervous about the tooth and that make you sick. We got your room cleaned up and put you in the bath. The tooth was still hanging on by a thread. You spent the rest of the night in the extra bedroom.

At about 3AM you woke up and ran to your Mom. The tooth had fallen out! You gave daddy a give hug and went back to bed. I was so proud of you. The look on your face was just adorable. This was a big moment in your life that I don't want to forget it.

The next morning you were so proud. You couldn't wait to show all your friends that you had lost your first tooth. You showed Ellie, Jaden, Lucas and Anna. The next night the tooth fairy came and left 5 dollars!
